          <h1>About</h1>
          <p>
            Hey I am Aaron! I have been a full stack software engineer for about 8 years now. 
            I have worked across a number of technologies ranging from embedded architectures to data pipelines. 
            There is no aspect of the industry that I will shy away from if it means that I get to learn a few new things along the way. 
            Currently, I am focusing most of my effort on building personal projects in new languages to help build up my toolset.
            I am also making it a personal goal to try and practice strict TDD at all times.
          </p>
          <p>
            This site is going to kind of act like my extended resume. 
            Most of the same stuff that I would include, but with a little extra flourish!
          </p>
          <p>
            Everything you see here is a single HTML page. 
            A simple resume-like format is all I need for a portfolio.
            Previously, this was built using ReactJS. 
            While it was pretty, it was much more than was needed for such a simple concept. 
            By reducing it to just HTML and CSS I was able to build a site that was a 10th of the size!

          <h1>Technologies</h1>
          <p>
            Over my time in the industry I have touched a few different languages and standards. I have tried my best to
            categorize these into my relative skill level with them.

              In my previous interviewing endeavors it has always been a struggle finding good interview prep resources.
              because of this I decided to create this simple Google form and sheet that aggregates good resources for
              those looking to
              build their skills in terms of interviewing for tech positions. Not really a development project I can
              take credit for
              but definitely something that I want to advertise where possible.
