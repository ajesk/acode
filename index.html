          <h1>About</h1>
          <p>
            Hey I am Aaron! Been a full stack software engineer for about 7 years now. I have worked across a number of
            technologies ranging from embedded architectures to data pipelines. There is no aspect of the industry that
            I will shy away from if it means that I get to learn a few new things along the way. Currently, I am
            focusing
            mostly on building out my skills with common patterns and trying to better internalize all of the
            usages/pros/cons
            of every approach. I am also making it a personal goal to try and practice strict TDD at all times.
          </p>
          <p>
            This site is going to kind of act like my extended resume. Most of the same stuff that I would submit to a
            job,
            but with a little extra flourish!
          </p>
          <p>
            Everything you see here is a single html page figured a simple
            resume-like format is a great way to create a small performant site.
            Previously this address was taken up by a ReactJS app. While it was pretty, I am pleasantly
            surprised that I was able to create another one that is more streamlined while being less than 10%
            the size!

          <h1>Technologies</h1>
          <p>
            Over my time in the industry I have touched a few different languages and standards. I have tried my best to
            categorize these into my relative skill level with them.

              In my previous interviewing endeavors it has always been a struggle finding good interview prep resources.
              because of this I decided to create this simple Google form and sheet that aggregates good resources for
              those looking to
              build their skills in terms of interviewing for tech positions. Not really a development project I can
              take credit for
              but definitely something that I want to advertise where possible.
